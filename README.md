# FYS3150 - Computational Physics I
Project repo for university course FYS3150 at UiO, Oslo. All code is written in collaboration with HÃ¥kon Lindholm and Lars Kristian Skaar.

## Project 1 
A numerical study of Poisson's problem devising linear algebra operations written in C++. 
## Project 2 
A numerical study of eigenvalue problems using numerical solvers (Jacobi rotators, etc).
## Project 3 
Modelling our solar system with high resolution using Euler methods.
## Project 4
Modelling critical phase transitions in magnetic materials using the Ising model as a baseline model. Variational Monte Carlo and Metropolis - Hastings algorithms. 
## Project 5
Modelling epidemic dynamics by solving multi-system differential equations.
