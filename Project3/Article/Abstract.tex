\section{Abstract}
	The scope of this numerical study is two-fold; for one we wish to delve into the study of three popular algorithms for solving ordinary differential equations, namely the Euler - Forward and Euler - Cromer methods, as well as the Velocity Verlet method. Secondly, it is an exercise in object oriented programming, in which the end result is a working model for our solar system. In our studies, we have concluded that the Verlocity Verlet algorithm is the optimal choice for solving the problem at hand, as it commits an error decreasing twice as fast as the errors committed by the Euler methods for increasing temporal resolution, all the while having an insignificantly longer run time compared to the Euler methods, differing by roughly 10\%. Secondly, we find that devising three main classes in our program, it is very easy to extend the problem to large systems, and more interestingly to extend our program to solve different physical systems seamlessly. In order to survey how realistic our model is, we have conducted several simulations in which we may compare our numerical results to observed and theoretical values, all which produce results enforcing the credibility of our model.  \\
