\section{Introduction}
  
    
    Setting out, this numerical project has a three-fold goal; studying three differential equation solvers, designing and devising an object oriented code and lastly making a model for our Solar System. We choose to look at this project as an exercise in object orientation, as this is an important programming model which allows developers to design software in which large data bases may be treated seamlessly and with high precision - when a certain data type, or \textit{object} is known, its inherent properties and behaviour may be cast into a class of objects displaying similar properties or behaviour. This allows the same logical structures to be devised across different, yet similar objects. In the first part of this article, we shall more formally define the problem at hand and how we object orient our code and implement the numerical schemes for solving $N$ - body motion in a system of celestial bodies. In this part we also explain how we have performed surveys of our model using logical test functions in lack of analytical solutions we may compare our model against. We later go on to present the myriad of results we have procured in this project and discuss these in light of the goals of the study. We will do this in an orderly fashion. Lastly we make some conclusive remarks on our findings and shed light on prospective changes.
