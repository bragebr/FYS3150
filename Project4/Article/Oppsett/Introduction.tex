\section{Introduction}
The scope of this numerical project is two-fold. For one, we wish to explore the vast numerical sea that is Monte Carlo methods, and in particular we seek out to develop a working code exemplar of the Metropolis - Hastings algorithm. The algorithm in itself is very general, so we focus our attention onto the Ising model, describing temperature dependent configurational phases in ferromagnetic materials. Secondly, as the reader may have worked out by now, we delve into the physical aspects of the Ising model itself, using our numerical methods to extract information about temperature and size dependency of magnetic phenomena in ferromagnetic materials which we model as spin lattices in which each lattice points holds a "spin up" or "spin down" attribute. It is our business in particular to determine the critical temperature $T_C$ where a spin lattice transitions from one magnetic phase to another. Firstly, we shall establish the mathematical framework for studying the Ising model and then proceed to explore the numerical implementation of the Metropolis - Hastings algorithm for our specific purpose. Moving forward then, we will present select results from our studies, and in light of these discuss what we have revealed about the MHA and also configurational phase transitions in the Ising model. Lastly we provide summary remarks on our work and obtained results.
